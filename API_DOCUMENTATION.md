## üß™ Testing the API

### Using cURL

**Get all businesses:**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/businesses"
```

**Create a new business:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/businesses" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "Test Business", "website": "https://test.com"}'
```

**Upload CSV:**
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/businesses/upload-csv" \
  -F "file=@businesses.csv"
```

### Using JavaScript (Frontend)

```javascript
// Get businesses
const response = await fetch('/api/businesses');
const data = await response.json();

// Create campaign
const campaign = await fetch('/api/campaigns', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'New Campaign',
    message_template: 'Hello {business_name}!'
  })
});
```

## üîê Security Considerations

1. **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated and sanitized
2. **File Upload Security**: CSV files are validated for format and size
3. **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using SQLAlchemy ORM with parameterized queries
4. **CORS Configuration**: Properly configured for frontend access
5. **Error Handling**: No sensitive information leaked in error messages

For production deployment, consider adding:
- JWT authentication
- API key management
- Request logging
- Input rate limiting per user
- HTTPS enforcement
